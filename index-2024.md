Then react and reflect on each area (what surprised you, what challenged you, what made you question, etc. Explain your reactions by reflecting on why you think you reacted this way.) in your Field Pad.
- Narrow the list of your start-up ideas (your final idea must be a start-up that will leverage information technology in some significant way.)
- Choose one of your ideas and complete a first iteration of your copy of the [Business Model Canvas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ROzBaICb4rM3W_qzVTQ48x3o4rBfGVMz?usp=sharing) for that best idea for your start-up tech business. **Note that you will present one idea to your potential investors on Friday, but the first iteration of your work on the canvas is due Thursday.**
  - Give your start-up a (hopefully catchy) title
  - Do a very small bit of research on the competition so you can discuss how your idea differs from the competition.
  - Use each section of the first iteration of the Business Model Canvas to summarize why you are excited about this idea and to hypothesize why it will be a success. In addition to the field pad work, submit your Business Model Canvas to the Google Classroom by 8 am on Thursday.

**For Friday**

- Note that for Friday, using Google slides, you will prepare a **5 minute pitch talk** for potential investors "pitching" your tech start-up idea. 
  - Title slide should include who, what, when, where, and why. 
  - You should have two or more additional slides, but be strategic! 5 minutes is very short, so be very concise! 
  - Images are always good to have, but be sure to credit them. 
  - The final slide should invite questions because there will be an additional 5 minutes for questions.

- Spend a full 15 minutes brainstorming a **list** of the areas of knowledge/experience where you are in some way much more expert than most other people, and for each very briefly explain why you are more expert than most. You should be able to generate a long list in that amount of time.
