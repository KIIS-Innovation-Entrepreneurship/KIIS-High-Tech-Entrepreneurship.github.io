**Day 3: Field Work:**
- Read pp 86-113 (pdf numbers) of [Business Model Generation](https://moodle.berea.edu/pluginfile.php/664986/mod_resource/content/1/Business_Model_Generation.pdf). Identify the main ideas. Then react and reflect on these main ideas (what surprised you, what challenged you, what made you question, etc. Explain your reactions by reflecting on why you think you reacted this way.) in your [Field Pad](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ROzBaICb4rM3W_qzVTQ48x3o4rBfGVMz?usp=sharing).
- Identify the best of your start-up ideas (it must be a start-up that will leverage information technology in some significant way.) 
- Complete a first iteration of your copy of the [Business Model Canvas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ROzBaICb4rM3W_qzVTQ48x3o4rBfGVMz?usp=sharing) for that best idea for your start-up tech business. **Note that you will present this to your potential investors on Thursday!**
- Then write up a one page report in your [Field Pad](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ROzBaICb4rM3W_qzVTQ48x3o4rBfGVMz?usp=sharing). This is intended to help you to be able to distill your ideas into short sound-bytes.
  - Give your start-up a (hopefully catchy) title
  - Research the competition and discuss how your idea differs from the competition
  - Use each section of the first iteration of the Business Model Canvas to summarize why you are excited about this idea and to hypothesize why it will be a success.
- Prepare a **5 minute pitch talk** for potential investors "pitching" your tech start-up idea. You must use Google slides, which you should place in [Day 4 Pitch Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/176jv5iHeXT7lqDU6DUYdGaWp9ul5Hihp?usp=sharing) by 8 am on Thursday.
  - Title slide should include who, what, when, where, and why. 
  - You should have two or more additional slides, but be strategic! 5 minutes is very short, so be very concise! 
  - Images are always good to have, but be sure to credit them. 
  - The final slide should invite questions because there will be an additional 5 minutes for questions.

- Spend a full 15 minutes brainstorming a **list** of the areas of knowledge/experience where you are in some way much more expert than most other people, and for each very briefly explain why you are more expert than most. You should be able to generate a long list in that amount of time.
