## The Final Deliverables 
#### All due at 8 am on Tuesday, June 18
### Final Pitch Deck
#### in class on June 18 you will use this to give a pitch talk of 10-12 minutes followed by around 5 minutes of questions

- Use Google Slides
- Between 10 and 15 Slides
- Should be primarily visual
- Remember, a pitch deck is ultimately just a summary of your start-up story. You are using the slides to effectively make a compelling argument on how your start-up has figured out how to solve a problem in a way that others have not. Slide number, order, etc should be secondary to your start-up story.
- Should be organized to tell the start-up story, including slides for:
  - Cover slide with company name, logo, and 2-7 word descriptor 
  - Problem/Opportunity
  - Solution/Value Proposition
  - Key elements of Business Model
  - Founder or Founding Team (with pictures)
  - Competition/Market opportunity
  - Initial funding model + growth opportunity
  - References
- Additional slides are fine if purposeful, some examples might include:
  - Use cases (this can be a useful way to summarize different things you learned in customer interviews because you can highlight different customer types)
  - Traction teasers

### One Page Executive Summary
#### Seriously, this should be exactly one page
- This should be a Google Doc that makes use of headers for organization
- Include (but use better headers!):
  - A Powerful Introduction
  - Problem/Opportunity
  - Solution/Value Proposition
  - Your Market/Competitors
  - You or Your Team
  - Your Business Model
  - Growth Opportunity

### Final Business Model Canvas
- Note that you have now tested your hypotheses, so all potentially questionable hypotheses must include statements of support.

### Final Market Analysis
- Succinctly state the market research problem
- Conduct competitive market analysis by collecting data from the internet and customer interviews
- Summarize what has been learned
